# Space-Objects-Visualisation
This is a copy of the repository of my first year capstone group project.

ABOUT:
Space Objects Visualisation allows the user to interactively explore and visualise a large dataset of the objects launched during the space age.
This includes interactive and dinamically resizable charts, customisable searching and sorting, graphical visualisations.
Significant care has been put into designing a visually compelling as well as functional GUI.
